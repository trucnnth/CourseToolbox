## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a **simple** formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can *embed* an R code chunk like this:

*I just use cmd+opt+i to insert this code chunk, and this line is in italic.*

```{r}
str(cars)
```

```{r}
print('Hello World!')
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
